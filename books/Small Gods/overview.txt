Lost in the chill deeps of space between the galaxies, it sails on forever, a flat, circular world carried on the back of a giant turtle— Discworld —a land where the unexpected can be expected. Where the strangest things happen to the nicest people. Like Brutha, a simple lad who only wants to tend his melon patch. Until one day he hears the voice of a god calling his name. A small god, to be sure. But bossy as Hell.


Religion is a competitive business in the Discworld. Everyone has their own opinion and their own gods, of every shape and size—all fighting for faith, followers, and a place at the top. So when the great god Om accidentally manifests himself as a lowly tortoise, stripped of all divine power, it’s clear he’s become less important than he realized.


In such instances, you need an acolyte, and fast. Enter Brutha, the Chosen One—or at least the only One available. He wants peace, justice and love—but that’s hard to achieve in a world where religion means power, and corruption reigns supreme.

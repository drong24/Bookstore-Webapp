'What I have most wanted to do... is to make political writing into an art' - George Orwell


"Still outlawed by regimes around the world, Animal Farm has always been political dynamite - so much so, it was nearly never published." - The Guardian


Animal Farm - the history of a revolution that went wrong - is George Orwell's brilliant satire on the corrupting influence of power.


When the downtrodden animals of Manor Farm overthrow their master Mr Jones and take over the farm themselves, they imagine it is the beginning of a life of freedom and equality. But gradually a cunning, ruthless elite among them, masterminded by the pigs Napoleon and Snowball, starts to take control. Soon the other animals discover that they are not all as equal as they thought, and find themselves hopelessly ensnared as one form of tyranny is replaced with another.


All animals are equal - but some are more equal than others


'It is the history of a revolution that went wrong - and of the excellent excuses that were forthcoming at every step for the perversion of the original doctrine.'--George Orwell
